# DevSecOps with Prisma Cloud

### DevSecOps
The foundation of DevSecOps lies in the DevOps movement, wherein development and operations functions have merged to make deployments faster, safer, and more repeatable. Common DevOps practices include automated infrastructure build pipelines (CI/CD) and version-controlled manifests (GitOps) to make it easier to control cloud deployments. By baking software and infrastructure quality requirements into the release lifecycle, teams save time manually reviewing code, letting teams focus on shipping features.

As deployments to production speed up, many traditional cloud security concepts break down. With the rise of containerized technologies, serverless functions, and IaC frameworks, it is increasingly harder to maintain visibility of cloud security posture.

By leveraging DevOps foundations, security and development teams can build security scanning and policy enforcement into automated pipelines. The ultimate goal with DevSecOps is to “shift cloud security left.” What shifting cloud security left means is automating it and embedding it earlier into the development lifecycle so that actions can be taken earlier. Preventing risky deployments is a more proactive approach to traditional cloud security which often slows down development teams with deployment rollbacks and disruptive fixes.

To successfully implement DevSecOps, it is critical that teams building secure infrastructure must embracing existing tools and workflows. At Palo Alto Networks, we’re committed to making it as simple, effective, and painless as possible to automate security controls and integrate them seamlessly into standard workflows.
